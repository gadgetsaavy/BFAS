Welcome to the most aggressive Ethereum arbitrage system you’ve ever seen.  
Powered by real flash loans, on-chain atomic execution, and graph-based arbitrage detection.  
This bot wraps and conceals transactions using Flashbots and deploys liquidity-aware pathfinding to hit multi-DEX profit routes **fast** and **stealthy**.

## Core Capabilities

- Flash Loan initiation using on-chain contract  
- Triangular and multi-asset arbitrage detection  
- MEV bundling via Flashbots relay  
- Liquidity-aware route building  
- Gas estimation for optimized profits

## Smart Contract

**`FlashLoanArbitrage.sol`**  
- Calls flash loan provider  
- Executes token swaps via profitable paths  
- Performs profit extraction  
- Withdrawals restricted to contract creator  

---

## Python Bots

- **`bellmanford.py`**: Builds and solves graph for arbitrage loops  
- **`liquidityaggregator.py`**: Polls token pairs for real-time pool depths  
- **`uniswapclient.py`**: Manages live trade quotes + execution  

---

## Deployment

```bash
python3 src/scripts/Deploy.py
```

---

## Usage

1. Run arbitrage pathfinder:  
   ```bash
   python3 src/bots/bellmanford.py
   ```
2. Deploy and trigger on-chain flash arbitrage  
3. Let `MEVWrapper` bundle and ship your private tx

## Environment Configuration

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
WALLET_ADDRESS=0xYourAddress
INFURA_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
FLASHBOTS_RELAY=https://relay.flashbots.net

## Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Run Tests

## Project Initialization Script

**`init_project.py`** creates the full directory structure, files, initializes Git, and pushes to GitHub.

### Script Flow

- Creates the entire `/src` structure  
- Generates template files for each module  
- Initializes a local Git repository  
- Creates a GitHub repo via API  
- Adds remote, commits files, and pushes to GitHub  
- Displays a styled terminal message:  
  > “Press any key to continue…” and holds terminal open
